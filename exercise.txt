- Install mysql server and client.
	$ sudo apt install mysql-server mysql-client-8.0
	* your version number may not be 8.0 depending on your ubunutu version.
- Connect to your mysql server via sudo:
	$ sudo mysql
	* You can create a user with a password etc, but this is not a must.
- start each session with the database with the command:
	$ set autocommit=0
	* remember that mysql's default is autocommit=1
- By using more than one terminal please create the following three scenarios:
	- Demo that out of date data is shown *even after it is changed and committed*
		First client connects
		Second client connects
		They both see same data
		Client 2 changes data and commits
		Client 1 still sees old data
	- Demo that out of date data is shown *even with a third client which attached*
		First client connects
		Second client connects
		They both see same data
		Client 2 changes data and commits
		Client 3 connects and already sees the new data
		Client 1 still sees out of date data.
	- Demo that a transaction fails if it is based on out of date data.
		First client connects
		Second client connects
		They both see same data
		Client 2 changes data and commits
		Client 1 sees out of date data.
		Client 1 tries to commit based on out of date data
		Client 1 commit is rejected
	Do the exercsies without a script.
